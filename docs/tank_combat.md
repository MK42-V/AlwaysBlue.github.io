### Based On FLAME

The goal of the Flame Engine is to provide a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for common problems that games developed with Flutter might share.

Some of the key features provided are:

- A game loop.
- A component/object system (FCS).
- Effects and particles.
- Collision detection.
- Gesture and input handling.
- Images, animations, sprites, and sprite sheets.
- General utilities to make development easier.

On top of those features, you can augment Flame with bridge packages. Through these libraries, you will be able to access bindings to other packages, including custom Flame components and helpers, in order to make integrations seamless.

Flame officially provides bridge libraries to the following packages:

- flame_audio for AudioPlayers: Play multiple audio files simultaneously.
- flame_bloc for Bloc: A predictable state management library.
- flame_fire_atlas for FireAtlas: Create texture atlases for games.
- flame_forge2d for Forge2D: A Box2D physics engine.
- flame_lint - Our set of linting (analysis_options.yaml) rules.
- flame_oxygen for Oxygen: A lightweight Entity Component System (ECS) framework.
- flame_rive for Rive: Create interactive animations.
- flame_svg for flutter_svg: Draw SVG files in Flutter.
- flame_tiled for Tiled: 2D tile map level editor.
